Operations in Linked List
In this lesson, we will learn about the following operations in a linked list:

Inserting into a linked list
Deleting from a linked list

Insert Into a Linked List
We can insert a node at any position in a linked list. In general, there are three cases for node insertion.

Insert a node at the end of a linked list (append).
Insert at the beginning of a linked list.
Insert at any given position.
Let's see how we can append a node to a linked list.

Time Complexity
To append an element to the end of a linked list, we first need to traverse through the list to reach the end. Hence, this results in a linear time complexity.

Time Complexity: O(n).
